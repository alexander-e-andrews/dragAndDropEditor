and easily taken css,html code which will be changed by a developer

Want to use templates or some kind of dyamic loading of various components that a user can use

Left bar:
Component list,
when a component is selected should have and options menu pop up

How to layout component code
-- Should create component options with this tool, and expand with JS


Do you replace innherhtml or add a child
--Adding children allows a less controlled design flow


Do layout elemnts come filled with divs
--with any flex u cnat add then, probably needs to be more dynamic

--setting inner html is not compatible with no includd layout divs

How do you selecte something like the three colimn elemnts
--INclude divs with a tag to go to the parent
